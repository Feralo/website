    "text": "Schoenhut's Fancy Baby Grand is beautifully designed with curved legs and an elegant style. It is extremely durable and sturdy, yet sophisticated in appearance. With 30 full-sized keys, this piano is a great way to introduce your child to basic keyboard skills and musical concepts. Chromatically tuned with a full two-octave span, small hammers strike metal rods, producing lovely chime-like tones. The piano never goes out of tune and the tone never changes. The Learning System, with its play-by-color assortment of songs, is designed to bring immediate success. A removable color-coordinated strip fits behind the keys to guide small fingers from chord to chord. As your child learns and grows, the color strip can be transferred to a larger piano, since the keys on Schoenhut toy pianos are of corresponding width. This teaches children proper \"finger stretch\" from the very beginning. The accompanying Songbook contains a collection of familiar tunes. This Learning System has been specially designed to build a child's confidence and develop basic playing skills. "
